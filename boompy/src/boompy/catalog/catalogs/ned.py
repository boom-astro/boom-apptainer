"""NED Local Volume Sample.

One ~1.2 GB FITS table, so there is exactly one chunk. `Current` always
redirects to the latest release; since 2026-04-24 that carries the galaxy
angular diameter columns (Diam, Diam_ba, Diam_pa, ...) the reader expects.

The download is converted to parquet before it is handed over. BOOM reads one
columnar format, and `astropy` -- already here for the archives -- is what reads
a FITS table; teaching Rust to do it meant linking cfitsio into every BOOM
binary to answer "give me this column as f64".
