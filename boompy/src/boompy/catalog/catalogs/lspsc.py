"""Legacy Survey Point Source Catalog (LSPSC).

Liu et al. 2025 (arXiv:2505.17174) publish these morphological
resolved/unresolved scores as a cone-search service at
https://ls-xgboost.lbl.gov/, not as files: `/getsources/{ra}/{dec}/{radius}`,
radius capped at 300 arcsec. Reconstructing 3.1e9 rows through that endpoint
would be around a million requests and hundreds of gigabytes against someone
else's research server, so BOOM does not.

Instead BOOM ingests an export of the copy it already holds. The
`export_catalog` task writes gzipped JSONL chunks plus a `manifest.json` from the
`LSPSC` collection, and this module stages them: BOOM is the provenance for its
own copy, and the manifest records which database and release produced it.

Stage the export directory at `$BOOM_LSPSC_DIR`, or leave it where
`export_catalog` puts it, at `<catalog data path>/export/LSPSC`.
