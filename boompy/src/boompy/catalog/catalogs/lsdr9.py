"""Legacy Survey DR9, from the NERSC sweep catalogs and their photo-z counterparts.

DR9 is not mirrored as HATS parquet the way DR10.1 is, so there is no column
projection to push down the wire: FITS binary tables are row-major, and the
whole file has to arrive to read the ~30 columns BOOM keeps. A chunk is
therefore one sweep file paired with its photo-z file -- fetched, merged,
converted and deleted before the next one, which keeps peak disk at a few
gigabytes rather than the ~0.2 TB dr9/north runs to in total.

Only `dr9/north` is listed. That is the BASS+MzLS reduction, covering the sky
DR10's DECam footprint does not reach; `dr9/south` is another terabyte
re-reducing sky DR10 already covers. Chunk ids carry the region, so adding the
south later leaves the north's ids -- and so a resumed ingest's record of which
chunks are done -- untouched.

The photo-z sweeps are row-matched to the sweeps rather than needing a join on
an object id: `sweep-X.fits` and `sweep-X-pz.fits` have the same rows in the
same order. That is checked rather than assumed, because a truncated download
would otherwise attach each source to a different source's redshift.
