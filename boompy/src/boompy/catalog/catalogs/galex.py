#: Plain HTTP because the host does not answer on 443 at all -- not a
#: preference, and not an oversight. GUVcat publishes no checksum alongside the
#: files either, so there is nothing to verify a download against. The rows
#: become crossmatch data, so anyone able to alter the connection could alter
#: what BOOM calls a match; a deployment that cannot accept that should fetch
#: the files out of band, verify them however it likes, and ingest GALEX as a
#: staged catalog instead.
