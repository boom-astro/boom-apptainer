"""AllWISE Source Catalog, from the LSDB HATS mirror.

This is the catalog that justifies boompy existing. AllWISE is served as a HATS
(HEALPix Adaptive Tiling Scheme) dataset, and `lsdb` is what reads one: there is
no plain file listing to walk, and reimplementing HATS partition resolution in
Rust to avoid one subprocess would be a poor trade.

The partitioning is also exactly the chunking we want -- one HEALPix pixel per
chunk, a few hundred MB of parquet each, out of a 748-million-source catalog
that would otherwise need hundreds of gigabytes of disk staged at once.
