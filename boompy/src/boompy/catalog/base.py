"""The chunk interface every catalog module implements.

BOOM's Rust side drives the ingest loop and calls in here twice per catalog:
once to enumerate the chunks, then once per chunk to fetch it. Keeping the loop
on the Rust side is what makes the ingest resumable and keeps peak disk at one
chunk -- so a catalog module only has to answer "what are the pieces?" and "put
this piece on disk".

A catalog is a **module**, not a class: there is only ever one of each, they
hold no state, and a base class here would document the interface without
enforcing it. `CatalogModule` below is a `typing.Protocol`, so a type checker
still verifies the shape structurally and there is nothing to inherit from.
