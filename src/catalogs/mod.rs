//! Archival catalogs: what BOOM crossmatches incoming alerts against, and how
//! each one gets into MongoDB.
//!
//! See [`docs/catalogs.md`](../../docs/catalogs.md). A catalog is declared once
//! in [`CATALOGS`] -- where its source lives is declared on the Python side, in
//! `boompy` -- and ingested by [`add_catalog`], which is a plain async function
//! so that the task system can call it directly rather than shelling out to a
//! binary.
//!
//! Ingest is **chunked**: the catalog is fetched, ingested and deleted one
//! chunk at a time, and each completed chunk is recorded. That bounds peak disk
//! at one chunk rather than one catalog -- NED is a gigabyte and AllWISE is
//! hundreds -- and it makes an interrupted run resumable, which matters when
//! the run takes a day and the host reboots.
