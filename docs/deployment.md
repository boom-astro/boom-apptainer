# Deploying a BOOM system

## Option 1: Single node with Docker Compose and a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner

### Preparation

1. Have a remote server ready and available.
1. Configure the DNS records of your domain to point to the IP of the server
   you just created.
1. Configure a wildcard subdomain for your domain, so that you can have
   multiple subdomains for different services, e.g. `*.boom.caltech.edu`.
   This will be useful for accessing different components,
   like `traefik.boom.caltech.edu`, `api.boom.caltech.edu`, etc.
1. Install and configure [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on
   the remote server (Docker Engine, not Docker Desktop).
1. Install [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).

### Create a public Traefik reverse proxy

We need a Traefik proxy to handle incoming connections and HTTPS certificates.
Note this will only need to be done once per server.

Create a remote directory to store your Traefik Docker Compose file:

```bash
mkdir -p /root/code/traefik-public/
```

Copy the Traefik Docker Compose file to your server.
This can be done by running the command `scp` or `rsync` in your local terminal:

```bash
rsync -a config/docker-compose.traefik.yml root@your-server.example.com:/root/code/traefik-public/
```

This Traefik instance will expect a Docker "public network" named
`traefik-public` to communicate with BOOM's API and Kafka instance.

This way, there will be a single public Traefik proxy that handles the
communication (HTTP and HTTPS) with the outside world, and then behind that,
there can be one or more stacks with different domains,
even if they are on the same single server.
This could enable, for example,
a production and staging instance on the same machine.

To create a Docker public network named `traefik-public` run the following
command in your remote server:

```bash
docker network create traefik-public
```

The Traefik Docker Compose file expects some environment variables to be set in
your terminal before starting it.
You can do it by running the following commands in your remote server.

Create the username for HTTP basic auth, e.g.,:

```bash
export USERNAME=admin
```

Create an environment variable with the password for HTTP basic auth, e.g.:

```bash
export PASSWORD=changethis
```

Use OpenSSL to generate the hashed version of the password for HTTP basic auth
and store it in an environment variable:

```bash
export HASHED_PASSWORD=$(openssl passwd -apr1 $PASSWORD)
```

To verify that the hashed password is correct, you can print it:

```bash
echo $HASHED_PASSWORD
```

Create an environment variable with the domain name for your server, e.g.:

```bash
export DOMAIN=boom.caltech.edu
```

Create an environment variable with the email for Let's Encrypt, e.g.:

```bash
export EMAIL=admin@$DOMAIN
```

Go to the directory where you copied the Traefik Docker Compose file in your
remote server:

```bash
cd /root/code/traefik-public/
```

Now with the environment variables set and the `docker-compose.traefik.yml` in
place,
you can start the Traefik Docker Compose project
by running the following command:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d
```

### Configure a GitHub Actions self-hosted runner for continuous deployment (CD)

On the remote server, while running as the `root` user,
create a user for GitHub Actions:

```bash
adduser github
```

Add Docker permissions to the `github` user:

```bash
usermod -aG docker github
```

Temporarily switch to the `github` user:

```bash
su - github
```

Go to the `github` user's home directory:

```bash
cd
```

Next,
[Install a GitHub Action self-hosted runner following the official guide](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners#adding-a-self-hosted-runner-to-a-repository).

When asked about labels, add a label for the environment, e.g. `production`.
You can also add labels later.

After installing, the guide will tell you to run a command to start the
runner.
However, to make sure it runs on startup and continues running,
we can install it as a service.
To do that, exit the `github` user and go back to the `root` user:

```bash
exit
```

Go to the `actions-runner` directory inside of the `github` user's home
directory:

```bash
cd /home/github/actions-runner
```

Install the self-hosted runner as a service with the user `github`:

```bash
./svc.sh install github
```

Start the service:

```bash
./svc.sh start
```

Check the status of the service:

```bash
./svc.sh status
```

You can read more about this in the official guide:
[Configuring the self-hosted runner application as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service).

### Set secrets for the GitHub Actions deployment workflow

In your repository settings,
configure secrets for the environment variables you need,
the same ones described above, including `SECRET_KEY`, etc.
Follow the [official GitHub guide for setting repository secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions#creating-secrets-for-a-repository).

See [`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`](/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml)
for the secrets that should be set.

## GitHub deploy safety controls

Production deploys are intentionally constrained by both repository settings and
the workflow in [`.github/workflows/deploy.yaml`](/.github/workflows/deploy.yaml):

1. A repository ruleset named `Tag creation` is active for tag refs (`~ALL`).
   It enforces tag creation/update/deletion protections, with bypass actors set
   to repository roles 2 and 5 (maintainers/admins).
1. The `production` environment has a deployment branch/tag rule that only
   allows tags matching `v*`.
1. The workflow enforces the same model at runtime:
   - it checks that the actor has `maintain` or `admin` repository access.
   - it validates that the selected deploy ref is a tag matching `v*`.

In practice, this means only approved release tags can be deployed to
production, reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorized production changes.
